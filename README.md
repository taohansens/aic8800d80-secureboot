# AIC8800D80 Linux Driver
This driver is for the AIC8800D80 chipset, supported by devices such as the Tenda U11.

Tested on Linux kernel 6.13-rc1 with Ubuntu and 6.1.0.27 with Debian 12.

### Attention
Before installing the driver, delete all aic8800-related folders under /lib/firmware. Using an incorrect firmware version may cause the system to freeze.

### Installation Steps
#### Copy udev rules:

Copy the aic.rules file to /lib/udev/rules.d/:

```bash
sudo cp aic.rules /lib/udev/rules.d/
```

#### Copy firmware:

Copy the aic8800D80 folder from ./fw to /lib/firmware/:

```bash
sudo cp -r ./fw/aic8800D80 /lib/firmware/
```
#### Navigate to the driver directory:

Change to the drivers/aic8800 directory:

```bash
cd ./drivers/aic8800
```

#### Compile and Install the Driver:

First, compile the driver:

```bash
make
```
Then, install the driver:

```bash
sudo make install
```

For any kernel updates, you'll need to reinstall the driver:

```bash
make clean
make
sudo make install
```

### Load the Driver
After installation, load the driver with the following command:

```bash
sudo modprobe aic8800_fdrv
```

### Verify the Module is Active
Check if the module is loaded correctly:

```bash
lsmod | grep aic
```
You should see output similar to:

```bash
aic8800_fdrv    536576  0
cfg80211        1146880 1   aic8800_fdrv
aic_load_fw     69632   1   aic8800_fdrv

```

### Verify Wi-Fi Device is Active
To check if the Wi-Fi interface is recognized, run:

```bash
iwconfig
```
If the device is still not active, check the kernel logs for any errors related to the driver:

```bash
sudo dmesg
```
